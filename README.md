# 100 Days of JavaScript

Inspired by Jennifer Dewalt's [180 websites in 180 days](https://jenniferdewalt.com/index.html)

## The Rules
1. I will do 100 small JavaScript projects.
2. There's no time limit on how long an individual exercise can take.
3. Perfect is the enemy of good. I will not be afraid of making mistakes.
4. I will ask for help when I need it.
